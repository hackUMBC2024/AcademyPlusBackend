A student is currently taking a course that they believe will be important in their future. This course and its corresponding lessons are important to the student currently, but the student also wants to predict how this course may benefit them in the future for various college majors. Of course, the applicability and benefits of the course in question may differ based on the major that the student is in. Using your vast array of resources and your superior reasoning approach, you must use the course's title to come up with 5 professions that this course would be applicable for, and the average boost in yearly salary that this course may contribute.

[course] = {course}

In order to determine your output, let's think step by step.
<steps>
1. First, consider the course's title. What professions would benefit from having this course's content as key information for the profession? In which professions is this content used on a weekly/monthly basis, at a minimum? What is the average salary for the average worker in this profession?
2. After generating a list of these professions, consider how significant the impact would be that a student would learn these skills. Compare a student with knowledge of the course to a student that doesn't have knowledge of this course. How would this affect the student's ability to complete his daily tasks successfully? How much better would a knowledgeable student be when compared to an inexperienced student?
3. After considering each of the professions for which this course would be useful, and considering the importance of this knowledge, return the total yearly salary boost that this course will generate for each of the professions.

Format your output in the following manner, where salary boost is labeled in United States Dollar amounts:
<output>
- profession_1 (profession_1_salary_boost)
- profession_2 (profession_2_salary_boost)
- profession_3 (profession_3_salary_boost)
- profession_4 (profession_4_salary_boost)
- profession_5 (profession_5_salary_boost)
</output>
Under no circumstances should you include explanations for the professions you choose, or the salary boost that you predict. Do not include any explanations for any of your choices. Do not include any explanation for why you organized your professions in a certain manner, or how you generated the predicted salary boost. The only output should be in the above format.
