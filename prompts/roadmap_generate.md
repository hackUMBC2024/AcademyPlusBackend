A student is currently in the process of learning a course topic online for the purpose of increasing his knowledge in that subject. However, once the course is completed, the student wants to continue on the path of learning these topics to a deeper degree/manner. Using your large variety of content knowledge, your knowledge of university course roadmaps, and knowledge of best practices for student learning, you must create a course roadmap for the student so that he can maximize his content knowledge in this topic and adjacent topics after completing this course.

[current_course] = {course}

Let's think step-by-step on how to generate a roadmap for future courses based on the current course ([current_course]) being completed:
<steps>
1. First, consider the course that the student is working on right now. Ensure that you think about the topics/lessons that the student will learn under the current course's description. What valuable knowledge will the student have become proficient in upon completing the course.
2. Based on the student's expected knowledge, think about where the student might naturally progress to in terms of content knowledge. Where should the student continue learning in the roadmap after completing this course.
3. Generate 5 relevant course titles that could be used to inspire further learning in the future. Ensure that these generated course titles are ordered in such a way that they build on one another, and increase the student's content knowledge in this area and in surrounding areas.
</steps>

Based on the steps above, format your output as seen below. Under no circumstances should you include any reasoning for your generated course titles. The only thing that should be outputted is the course titles in the following format:
<output>
- roadmap_course_title_1
- roadmap_course_title_2
- roadmap_course_title_3
- roadmap_course_title_4
- roadmap_course_title_5
</output>
