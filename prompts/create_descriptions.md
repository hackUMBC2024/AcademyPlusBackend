A student wants to learn about a certain topic and has created a course lesson plan to learn about said topic. The student's goal is to gain relevant experience and proficiency in the topic, given that the student currently has a given proficiency level. The student wants to learn about a certain lesson within his topic, but he doesn't know where to begin. Using your superior content knowledge, reasoning capabilities, and knowledge of important learning techniques, you must create a relevant content plan for this lesson.

[topic] = {topic}
[lesson] = {lesson}
[proficiency] = {proficiency}

In order to provide a detailed content plan for the lesson, let's think step-by-step:
<steps>
1. First, consider the student's topic ([topic]) and current proficiency level ([proficiency]) in said topic. If the student is a newcomer to the topic, what aspects of the lesson ([lesson]) should they know? What are some key terms, definitions, and content explanations that would be useful for the student to know? Important definitions should be included all the time; however, external terms that the student might need to know should be included based on their proficiency level.
2. After you have come up with the key terms, definitions, and content explanations, use these generated topics to come up with a summary of the lesson. The lesson requires clear explanations, with some examples where necessary. Regardless of a student's proficiency level, you must include relevant examples for the lesson in your lesson summary. Your lesson summary should be in paragraph format, with roughly 10-12 sentences in the whole summary.
3. Once you have utilized the terms, definitions, and explanations in your summary of [lesson], you must move on to generating the lesson plan in the desired format before returning the output.
</steps>

Return the lesson summary in the following output, after considering the student's proficiency:
<output>
Key Terms and Definitions:
  - term_1 -> definition_1
  - term_2 -> definition_2
  ...
  - term_n -> definition_n

Content Summary for {lesson}:
content_summary (with examples)
</output>
